Current dependencies are `ripgrep`

### XCode Colour Scheme

I like to have as little dependencies as possible so I have bundled the colour scheme into this repo. The original [can be found here](https://github.com/arzg/vim-colors-xcode).
To update the colour schemes with the repo if git is installed.	arzg/vim-colors-xcode is licensed under the ISC License.
```
git clone https://github.com/arzg/vim-colors-xcode.git $TMPDIR/vim-colors-xcode
cp -r $TMPDIR/vim-colors-xcode/{autoload,colors,doc} ~/.vim
```
