# TODO

A collection of small things that need fixing, and new features

- [ ] `shell/git_extras.sh` scripts don't play nicely with filenames containing spaces
- [ ] `shell/dir_jumping.sh` scripts don't play nicely with directories containing spaces
- [ ] bettergrep `<leader>f` command in Vim doesn't work with complex search queries
- [ ] `hlint` can fix linting issues, but this isn't implemented in my vim linting plugin
- [x] `shell/view_git_unstaged_file.sh` script doesn't format the output nicely
